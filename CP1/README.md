## Introduction

These are my answers to Course Project 1 of "Exploratory Data Analysis" 

###Plot1

###Plot2

![plot2](plot2.png)

###Plot3

![plot3](plot3.png)

###Plot4

![plot4](plot4.png)

Note that the bottom right graph of plot4 does look a little different than the answers, and this is a documented issue:

It has to do with graphs generated on different operating systems and versions of R.
